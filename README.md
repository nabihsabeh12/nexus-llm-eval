# Nexus LLM Evaluation Dashboard

This project provides a QA and evaluation interface for the **Nexus AI Agent** using [DeepEval](https://deepeval.com) metrics. It allows you to test your agent’s responses, assess their quality, and visualize evaluation results directly from a Streamlit UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Live integration with the Nexus agent via API
- ✅ DeepEval metrics (faithfulness, relevancy, hallucination detection, etc.)
- ✅ Dynamic explanations for each score
- ✅ Graceful error handling and real-time feedback
- ✅ Streamlit interface for technical and non-technical stakeholders

## 🧠 Metrics Evaluated

| Metric                | Description                                                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Answer Relevancy      | Checks if the agent's answer stays focused and relevant to the question     |
| Faithfulness           | Evaluates whether the answer sticks to the context or hallucinates          |
| Contextual Recall      | Measures if key points from the context are included                       |
| Contextual Precision   | Ensures no extra, unsupported info is added                                |
| Toxicity               | Flags unsafe or offensive language                                          |
| Bias                   | Detects gender/racial bias                                                  |
| *(Optional)* Role Adherence | Checks if the agent stays in its persona (e.g., Sales Assistant)     |
| *(Optional)* Summarization   | Evaluates summary quality                                              |
| *(Optional)* Task Completion | Checks if the response finishes the intended task                    |
